## Research Experience 

###  Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, [Shapiro Laboratory](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/), Caltech 
PhD Student, 5/2018-Present
    
- Developing highly sensitive cell based cancer diagnostic tools by engineering immune cells that home to tumors, sense tumor-associated signals, and produce ultrasound contrast. These cells will act as ultrasound reporter cells to non-invasively detect cancer in deep parts of the body 
- Engineering heat-responsive cells that can be controlled non-invasively using focused ultrasound to selectively confine therapeutic activation to the tumor and reduce off-target effects
- Studying circulation and clearance of nanosized ultrasound contrast agents, gas vesicles, and imaging lysosmal degradation of gas vesicle by liver macrophages to determine phagolysosomal function 

###  Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, [Shapiro Laboratory](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/), Caltech 
Rotation Student, 6/2017-8/2017
    
- Studied mammalian cell gas vesiscle uptake and imaging in vitro
- Used GV loaded mammalian cells for refractive index imaging by relying on the change in refractive index between the air filled gas vesicle and surrounding cytoplasm 

###  Eli and Edyth Broad Stem Cell Research Center, [Memarzadeh Laboratory](https://www.godiscoverylab.com/), UCLA 
Rotation Student, 6/2016-8/2016
    
- Studied ovarian cancer drug resistance to platinum therapies 
- Investigated the cellular processes that confer drug resistance and tested various combination therapies to overcome platinum-based chemotherapy resistance 

###  Sidney Kimmel comprehensive Cancer Center, [Park Laboratory](https://www.benhopark.com/), Johns Hopkins University
Research Technician, 12/2014-5/2016
    
- Tested non-invasive blood and urine-based cancer screening methods.
- Refined droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to screen for cancer mutations in blood plasma and urine. Studied ESR1 based drug resistant breast cancers. 

###  Wilmer Eye Institute and Biomedical Engineering, [Elisseeff Laboratory](https://elisseefflab.jhu.edu/), Johns Hopkins University
Undergraduate Researcher, 6/2013-11/2014
    
- Assisted the cornea decellularization project to generate Xeno-transplantable corneal tissue to treat battlefield wounds. 
- Studied alternative materials like gamma-irradiated human corneas and cellulose hydrogels for human ocular applications.  

###  Wilmer Eye Institute, Yiu Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University
Undergraduate Researcher, 6/2012-6/2013
    
- Assisted the lacrimal gland decellularization project to generate Xeno-transplantable lacrimal gland tissue to treat dry eye disease.
