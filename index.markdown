Hi! I'm currently a 3rd year Bioengineering PhD student at Caltech in the Shapiro Lab within the UCLA-Caltech MD/PhD program. My research involes engineering cell-based cancer diagnostic and therapeutic tools. I was named a [2020 PD Soros Fellow](https://www.pdsoros.org/meet-the-fellows/justin-lee) to support my research. I am working towards becoming a neurosugeron-scientist to treat patients with neuropsychiatric disorders while conducting cutting-edge research to address important challenges in the field. 

I'm available for private pre-medical advising and medical school application consulting. Please email me at [justinleemdphd@gmail.com](mailto:justinleemdphd@gmail.com) for more information.
