Hi! I'm currently a 3rd Year Bioengineering PhD student in the Shapiro lab at Caltech and am part of the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program working towards both MD and PhD degrees. My current research interests include synthetic biology, immunology, and noninvasive medicine. I am working towards becoming a neurosurgeon-scientist, and I hope to one day combine my training in neurological surgery and translational reserach to improve outcomes for patients suffering from brain neoplasms.
