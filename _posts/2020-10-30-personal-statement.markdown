title: "How I wrote a PD Soros Winning Personal Statement"
---
My brainstorming and writing process with some takeaways to help you in your own writing. 

# Prompt
Tell us about your experiences as a New American. Whether as an immigrant yourself, or as a child of immigrants, how have your experiences as a New American informed and shaped who you are and your accomplishments?
Feel free to discuss how individual people (such as family or teachers), institutions, aspects of law, culture, society or American governance made an impact on your life as an immigrant or child of immigrants. The program is interested in understanding the context of your personal, professional, and academic accomplishment

How I interpreted this prompt: I viewed this as a Personal Statement, but it is specifically asking about how my upbringing as the child of immigrants shaped my life, accomplishments and goals. 

# My Brainstorming Process
When I wrote my first essay (I won the fellowship the second time I applied) I immediately gravitated to parts of my journey that were the most obviously influenced by my immigrant roots – growing up food and cooking were hugely influential within our family. Some of my earliest memories were gardening with my grandparents and homecooked meals was an opportunity for us to cook and come together. These experiences motivated me to work as a line cook during my undergraduate training and I loved the challenge of learning how to cook in a professional kitchen and using food as a medium to serve others. I connected this desire to serve through food with my desire to serve others through medicine and science. 

However, I wasn’t selected as a finalist in 2019, so when I reapplied, I took a step back to consider my journey. I thought of my most formative experiences from when I was younger to my current life stage, and I began to write everything down. Through this exercise, I realized that water polo was easily the most important part of my life as a child - not cooking in relation to my Korean heritage. I had played water polo for 10 years by the time I was a senior in high school and it deeply shaped who I was and what I believed in. Some of the lessons I learned while training and competing are still deeply ingrained in me, and although this wasn’t necessarily a classic ‘New American’ experience, I wanted to highlight it because it was my authentic story. 

Once I had this core story element, I thought about why water polo was so important and picked out the most important parts of my journey; I wrote down notes about my love of improving through practice and what I learned from the toughest loss of my career and how playing water polo provided me the great opportunity of attending Johns Hopkins University. I also thought deeply about why I had wanted to pursue medicine in the first place. I outlined the pain I experienced seeing my grandparents fall ill and pass away as a senior in high school and how it completely changed my trajectory. 

As I thought about my premedical journey, I had previously been hesitant to discuss my struggles in during my time as an undergraduate. For some reason, I believe incorrectly that stories should be clean and logical. I wanted to assert that I had wanted to be a doctor for many years and worked towards that path. But life is rarely ever cut and dry, and my story actually involved constant failure and subsequent growth. I simply was not prepared to be a pre-med when I first started at Hopkins and it showed. 

The next part of my story was the easiest to think about because it involved the experineces that led me to not only pursue and MD, but also work towards a PhD. I reflected on my biomedical research opportunities and how I began to love science, and how these experiences informed me of my desire to become a future neurosurgeon-scientist.

At the end of my brainstorming session, I had complied a list of short stories that best described my story, accomplishments and future goals. The next step was to tie it all together.  

# Putting it together 
To say that I wrote and rewrote is an understatement – it probably took 6 drafts to write a story that I liked enough to start editing and sending out for feedback. Something helpful that I practiced during writing was to disconnect from my own writing. I’ve found, especially for deeply personal essays like this one, I have the tendency to get attached to certain words and stylistic choices that may actually not be the best way to write a certain part of the story. After writing a draft, I tried to be as objective as possible. Instead of asking myself what I didn’t like about the particular draft, I tried to attack my own writing. What was good about it? 

The major considerations for me were to write a truly authetic story, have an introduction that captured the reader’s attention, and highlighting how being the son of immigrants taught me the importance of family and community. I also grappled with the overall structure of the story. Should I write in a way that has a thesis? I.e. “I’m working towards becoming a neurosurgeon-scientist, and here are the things that have informed my decision” Or, was it better to have time drive the story? I ultimately settled on the latter and described my journey from being a water polo playing kid in LA to becoming an MD-PhD candidate, but you may settle on a different organizational structure entirely. 

# Takeaways
1.	**Be as authentic as possible to your story**: Instead of writing what you think others want to hear. By definition, you have a unique journey, and staying true to this story will make your essay memorable instead of cliché.  
2.	**Get excited about rewriting**: Good writing often takes time, and I have never written a good first draft that I’ve stuck with. It isn’t until many rounds of revisions and fine-tuning that I’ve been able to write something compelling. 
3.	**Ask for feedback and ask early**: Don’t be afraid to reach out to Fellows who have won and people in your life who know you well for feedback on your essay. Feedback will be integral in helping you see blind spots in your writing and will help you write a better story – just make sure your voice isn’t lost in other people’s revisions. 

Here is the [essay](https://pdfhost.io/v/7H1bYzfaq_JLee_Soros_2020pdf.pdf) I submitted in 2020! You’ll have your own story, but hopefully this post and my essay provide some inspiration in your writing journey!
